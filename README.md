## Creation

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## Developing

Install dependencies with:

```bash
yarn install
```

Start a development server with either of these:

```bash
# start server, link provided in output
yarn dev

# start server, open in new tab
yarn dev --open

# start server, make available for other devices on local network
yarn dev --host

# all of the above
yarn dev --host --open
```

## Building for production

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
yarn build
```

> You can preview the built app with `yarn preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
