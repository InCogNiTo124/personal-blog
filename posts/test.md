# My first blogpost

## How is this made

Things I had to do:
- parse md file
- extract the metadata
- read the sqlite

This I want to do:
1. deploy this
1. preferably in python

**rather cool, dontya think**

`This is monospaced`

This is another paragraph.[^1]

>>> print('Is this Python code?')
True


```
More code? perhaps?
$ echo $SHELL
```

[^1] Yup, it's *monospaced af*

### Tables?
[#tablecounter Table @mytable: some interesting stuff]
[#tablecounter Table @mytable: some more interesting stuff]


```math
x^2
```
